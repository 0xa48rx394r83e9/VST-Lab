# VST-Lab

## Overview
VST-Lab is a project dedicated to experimenting with various approaches for creating VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins. The goal is to evaluate different frameworks and methodologies to determine their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different types of audio plugins.

## Objectives
- Implement the same VST plugin using multiple frameworks and approaches
- Compare and contrast the development process, performance, and features of each method
- Document findings to inform future plugin development decisions

## Approaches
The project explores the following approaches:

1. JUCE Framework
2. iPlug 2
3. WDL-OL
4. VST SDK (from scratch)
5. HISE
6. Dexed

## Project Structure
Each approach has its own directory containing:
- Source code
- Build instructions
- Performance metrics
- Additional notes

## Evaluation Criteria
- Ease of development
- Cross-platform compatibility
- CPU usage
- Memory footprint
- Latency
- Feature set and extensibility
- Community support and documentation

## Acknowledgments
- VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH

## Future Plans
This project serves as a precursor to a web-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) development initiative. Insights gained from VST-Lab will inform the architecture and implementation of the web DAW project.
